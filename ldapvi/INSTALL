Installation:
  $ ./configure && gmake
  # gmake install

Prerequisites:
  - Recent OpenLDAP client library (2.1.25 is known to work)
  - glib-2.0
  - popt
  - curses
  - GNU make

Tested on:
  Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, IRIX


FIXME: With --enable-debug, quite some warnings about missing function
prototypes are printed.  Most (but not all?) of them go away with
-D_BSD_SOURCE.  However, _BSD_SOURCE appear to be some kind of Linuxism,
and I am not at all sure why we need it in this case.
