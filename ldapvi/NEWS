1.x 2006-xx-yy
  - always replace entire attributes (fixing a bug reported by Javier Barroso)
  - preprocessor sellout: automagically #ifdefed support for libldap 2.1
  - incompatible change: value encoding md5 renamed to cryptmd5
  - new value encodings md5, smd5, sha1, ssha1 (thanks to Michael Hanselmann)
  - new configure option --with-libcrypto
  - extended ldapvi syntax with change records, new key 'V'
  - UTF-8 support; new command line option --encoding
  - fixed LDIF export to always Base64-encode non-ASCII values

1.5 2005-12-11
  - fixed argument parsing (thanks to Andrea Barisani for the report)

1.4 2005-11-15 r43
  - updated for libldap 2.2
  - cygwin works
  - fixed bogus modify operation when moving an entry without changing its rdn
  - new command line option --tls
  - new command line option -R
  - workaround for Microsoft ROOT DSE oddity: need * instead of +

1.3 2005-11-13 r33
  * last release to require libldap 2.1
  - in ldap_delete, treat notAllowedOnNonLeaf as non-fatal, allowing
    subtrees to be deleted in incorrect order
  - check for empty DNs later, so that search results including the
    ROOT DSE do not lead to a parse error anymore
  - for syntax errors, try to open the editor near the error position.
    (This assumes support for the +N argument vi and emacs understand.)
  - new command line argument --config: print basic LDAP library parameters
    to standard output for easy .ldaprc setup
  - new command line argument --discover: as an alternative to --base,
    query the ROOT DSE for all namingContexts and repeat searching in
    all contexts automatically
  - new command line argument --class: specify objectclasses at the
    command line that are looked up and inserted as a template

1.2 2004-07-07 r18 (patch-17)
  - fixed segfault: allow deletions to be skipped
    (thanks to Gerfried Fuchs for the bug report)
  - MD5 hashes are stored in crypt()-format, so prepend {CRYPT}, not {MD5}

1.1 2004-01-27 r9 (patch-8)
  - fixed compare() bugs involving fastcmp()
    (thanks to Bernardo Innocenti for the bug report)
  - fixed deleteoldrdn in LDIF output
